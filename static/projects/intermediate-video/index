<h1>Intermediate Video</h1>
<p>
During first semester of junior year, I took Intermediate Video with Chris Skinner. Over the course of four months, we had three large video projects to design and produce &mdash; two were to be originals, and one was to be a reproduction of something from Hollywood.

<b>Project 1: Amy, OCD</b> &mdash; <a href="http://vimeo.com/6732774">Watch it!</a>

For this project, unfortunately, the <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/09/24/184930.html">introductory blog post</a> was also the final one; I hadn't yet thought to write about the process as it went along.

<b>Project 2: The Usual Suspects</b> &mdash; <a href="http://vimeo.com/7068732">Watch it!</a>

This was (obviously) the reproduction piece; I chose to reproduce the last three-or-so minutes of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/">The Usual Suspects</a>. I wrote a number of blog posts along the way: <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/09/25/044803.html">Shots, Audio, a Script</a>; <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/09/27/055826.html">Props</a>; <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/10/09/031627.html">Mug Smash</a>; <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/10/13/053653.html">And so it begins...</a>; and, finally, <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/10/15/024807.html">That's a Wrap!</a>

<b>Project 3: α ↔ ω</b> &mdash; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7zgx5hW0xg&feature=player_embedded">Watch it!</a>

The final project also consumed the most time by far &mdash; and I didn't manage to finish it in time. While I was hoping to get timelapse video of plants both growing and dying, I failed to kill any plants within the timeframe of the project. Luckily, however, I got <em>plenty</em> of footage of growth.

This project was unique out of these three (and out of the class) because it was created entirely without the use of a real video camera, instead being formed from tens of thousands of frames from two still cameras.

There were a bunch of blog posts while the project was still in progress: <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/11/24/221441.html">The Beginnings</a>; <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/11/25/000736.html">An Introduction</a>; <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/11/25/004212.html">The Process</a>; <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/12/03/003324.html">More Pictures</a>; and <a href="http://hortont.com/blog/posts/2009/12/10/065934.html">The End</a>.
