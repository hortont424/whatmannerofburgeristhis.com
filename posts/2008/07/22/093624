My PowerMac G4 seems to have stopped working. Luckily, Dad brought a <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=58226">G3 B&amp;W</a> home from our neighbor's a few months ago, so check it out!:

What with crooked disks and a 300MHz CPU, the chances of this being a lasting solution are somewhat slim; I'm going to replace Trin with a small homebuilt machine (based off a Shuttle box)...

Also... this is running inside a chroot off of the Debian 4.0 install CD, so if it goes down... don't look at me :-)
