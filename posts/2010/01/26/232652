Already getting to work! Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays are going to be really boring, Tuesdays and Fridays are going to be really long but really, really awesome.

That's the output of my first graphics project (the "getting GL set up" project, nothing particularly annoying).

Finished this week's homework today; yay! Tomorrow is a day to relax (no Bio lab this week), hang out, get concert tickets, watch the Apple keynote, and do a phone interview for my Mathematica certification. FUN!
