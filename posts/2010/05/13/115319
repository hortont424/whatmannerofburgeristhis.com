<p> I've mostly spent the semester doing homework; I didn't make as
much progress on Clutterhs as I had planned. I hope once that I'm done
with finals, I'll have time to make the various changes I want and
finish binding Clutter 1.2. The release of Clutter 0.2 is still
waiting on those, as well as a release of
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/gtk2hs/">
gtk2hs</a>.
</p>
<p>
In total, I've completed 58 physics homework assignments, 3 essays, 6
tests, a large number of class exercises and quizzes, and 3 upcoming
finals. I've spent countless hours doing nothing but math. On
occasion, there was lots of help from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica">
Mathematica</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the 3 physics classes I took this semester (Electromagnetic Theory,
Intro to Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics),
in total I did 315 pages of LaTeX/
<a href="http://www.lyx.org/">
Lyx
</a>
homework at an average length of
5.4 pages each. Nearly all of that being just
<a href="http://files.whatmannerofburgeristhis.com/qmech_hw18.pdf">
math</a>, with an
<a href="http://files.whatmannerofburgeristhis.com/qmech_hw7.pdf">
occasional graph
</a>
or chart. This is in addition to the countless scraps of paper I
occasionally used (although as time passes I find myself just doing
nearly all of the simple algebra in my head and entering directly into
Lyx.)

I'm rather disappointed to not be going anywhere this summer. I
applied to over a dozen different research programs for the summer for
physics and astronomy at a wide array of random places; I was rejected
from all of them. I finally did get accepted to work on
<a href="http://milkyway.cs.rpi.edu/milkyway/">
milkyway@home</a>, which is what I'll be working on this summer. I'm
glad to be working on this, although I really don't want to stay in
Troy. It may be my ideal research project.
</p>
<p>
I accidentally got accepted to <a
href="http://code.google.com/soc/">GSoC</a>.  I applied as a final
fallback in case I didn't get accepted to do research with
milkyway@home. I found out after the GSoC deadline, and some time
before the selected students were announced I dropped out as a
student, at least according to melange. A while later it seems I was
accepted anyway to work on the gobject introspection based binding
generator for gtk2hs. I'll probably end up doing some work on this
over the summer; it might also become what I work on next semester for
<a href="http://rcos.cs.rpi.edu/"> RCOS</a>. One of the other rejected
Haskell proposals is now taking my place.
