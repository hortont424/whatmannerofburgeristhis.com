One of the primary features of this blog from near the beginning was
the addition of the
<a href="http://www.cornify.com/">
   Cornify
</a>
button, currently at the top of the page. It makes unicorns
happen.  Last weekend at
<a href="http://roflcon.org/">
   ROFLCon
</a>
I had this picture taken of me with a unicorn, and with the guy who made
Cornify right behind me wearing a unicorn shirt.

Unicorns are pretty cool.
