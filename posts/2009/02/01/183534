Today at lunch a new word was invented: banantics- (banana antics) having antics similar to those of a banana.Â  Examples of banantics include rocking around end to end like something with a banana shape, e.g. a banana. This is a new, nice word. It may not be as nice a word as 'pelican' but it's still a very nice word. I don't really like bananas all that much, although I talk about them a lot.
