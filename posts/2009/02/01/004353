So unicorns and rainbows are pretty cool. So here's this button. It makes unicorns. Ideally it would be part of the wordpress theme, but really I'm too lazy to figure out how to do that now, so here's a unicorn button.

You might get unicorns in your unicorns, and unicorns may end up covering the unicorn button, which ends up being quite the shame because then it's more difficult to make more unicorns appear. When more unicorns appear it is a wonderful thing. Especially if they sparkle.

Michael Javascript asked for me to "give me credit, man" so here is a credit. It is a unicode butterfly Ӝ. I'll throw in some unicode hearts, an airplane and a euro too.  ♥♥✈ ♥€
