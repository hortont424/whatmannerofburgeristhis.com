I discovered the other day that I could see my tongues' shadow if I stick it out far enough and look. I don't think I had ever seen my tongue's shadow before. It's quite the development. I'm not sure how I functioned before I knew I could see my tongue's shadow. This is even more exciting when a few months ago I discovered I could see my tongue if I stuck it out far enough. That was quite the day. My tongue got really tired.
