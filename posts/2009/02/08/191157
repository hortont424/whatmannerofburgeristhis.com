Well if you noticed the cornify button has been integrated into the wordpress theme, so now you can always get unicorns on this blog. It's really exciting. Unicorns are wonderful and make happy things happen, even though Amy is really mean and says unicorns are for pansies with lots of feelings. Amy hates unicorns. Why is Amy so mean to me? Why is she so mean to unicorns?

The internet really needs more unicorns, so a good idea for an Epiphany extension written with Seed would be for cornification. This should be done.

Anyway, this blog can now be found at <a href="http://whatmannerofburgeristhis.com" target="_blank">http://whatmannerofburgeristhis.com</a> too for some reason.
