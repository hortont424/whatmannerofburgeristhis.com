I've made an early release of Clutterhs, and it's onÂ <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clutterhs">Hackage</a>. There's still a fair number of things that don't work yet, and lots of messy code that needs to be cleaned up, but most of the core stuff should work. There isn't a tutorial yet, but overall usage is similar to gtk2hs. If you want to try it, the best thing to do would be to look at the simple demos in the <a href="http://jayne.hortont.com/git/cgit.cgi/clutterhs.git/tree/clutter/demo">git repo</a>. They aren't very good examples, and just sort of use a bunch of random stuff but they should help with the general idea of how to use it (which is still quite likely to change).
