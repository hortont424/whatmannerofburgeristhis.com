Sometime between last night and this morning I may have had something of a Eureka moment about all of the problems I've been wondering about. I've realized I made a huge mistake when dealing with GObject Properties / Attributes that should be easy to fix. I missed something huge when looking at how<a title="gtk2hs" href="http://www.haskell.org/gtk2hs/" target="_blank"> gtk2hs</a> deals with properties. I think I  can now easily avoid doing dirty things which I was very unhappy with to deal with functions which take GValues  (except for maybe the Model stuff).  I'm going to redo the animate* functions so you no longer have to deal with the dirty named property stuff directly, which is very unHaskelly and an obvious source of mistakes, as soon as possible.
